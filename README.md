##Peace of Mind+, A fork of Fairphone's app

[![Peace of Mind+][img_github]][link_peaceofmindplus_playstore]

###Disconnect from the World, if only for a moment!

An open-source fork of Fairphone's Peace of Mind app.

> We become more conscious of our phones as our lives become increasingly connected. Would you like to disconnect, if only for a moment? Your phone will go silent and disconnect from the world: no e-mail, no status updates, no SMS and no phone calls. Choose how long you wish to disconnect (up to 12 hours).

Originally developed by **Kwame Corporation** for the upcoming **Fairphone**, [Peace of Mind+][link_peaceofmindplus_playstore] aims simply to bring this beautiful app to other devices, and for future Fairphone-owners patiently waiting to receive their phone!

Peace of Mind+ is an open-source project released under the Apache License version 2.0.

**Disclaimer:** This is not the official App, and I'm not related to Kwame Corporation or the Fairphone project, except for buying a Fairphone device. Credit (and many thanks) go to Fairphone/Kwamecorp!

##Features
* Turn Airplane mode on for up to 12 hours.
* Settings to set maximum duration (3, 6 or 12 hours) and choose mode (airplane/silent).
* Supports all Android devices using Android ICS (4.0) or later.
* On Android 4.2+ devices, the app requires Root privileges to enable the Airplane Mode. On non-rooted phones (or if SU is declined) the app enables Silent Mode instead. This is due to security changes introduced by Google in Android SDK version 17.

*Note:* Peace of Mind+ is basically Airplane Mode with a timer. All phone calls, including emergency calls, are disabled during the Airplane/PeaceOfMind Mode. You'll need to turn off the app to enable calls!
